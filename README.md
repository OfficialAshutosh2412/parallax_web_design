# Parallax Effect Design



Parallax effect is a web site design trend where the background content (i.e. an image) is may fixed or may moved at a different speed than the foreground content while scrolling.

This project is just a simple web design, but with a parallax effect design where, background is fixed while scrolling and overlay contents move freely as normally on scrolling.

This project contain little number of image section with a heading overlay, and little number of text section, both design section arranged in alternative manner.

The theme of the project is Naruto Shipuden, which is a widely popular anime series in the world.

User can modify it for its own design purpose.
User just have to download the projec and edit wit vscode or any text editor they would like to use.

In this project, I used demo paragraphs and HTML5 tag section for grouping elements, and CSS3 properties.

I also used some of the images which are locally available in the project "img" directory, I did not used any CDN for image like unsapmle or unsplash APIs.

It supports any browser to rendering the project.
Thank you.
